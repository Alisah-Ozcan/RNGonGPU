# Security Policy

## Overview
RNGonGPU is a GPU-based random number generation library for secure applications. It complies with NISTâ€™s [Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1.pdf), ensuring stringent security and reproducibility. Unlike [cuRAND](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/curand/index.html), which is primarily tailored for simulations without cryptographic security, RNGonGPU guarantees both reproducible and secure outputs by employing AES to secure each generated value, thereby safeguarding against potential attacks. While every effort has been made to adhere to these rigorous standards, RNGonGPU is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied, and the developer(s) do not assume any liability for issues or damages arising from its use.
